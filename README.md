# Sudoku Generator in C++
<p>This Sudoku Generator is an application programmed in C++ and the help of QT5. 
The algorithmic is based on the paper <a href="http://zhangroup.aporc.org/images/files/Paper_3485.pdf">Sudoku Puzzles Generating: from Easy to Evil</a> and the underlying cmake folder structure was provided by <a href="https://github.com/euler0/mini-cmake-qt">mini-cmake-qt</a> (I gave up on doing it by myself).
The program code is in parts equal to my previous project <a href="https://github.com/Gansgar/Sudoku-Generator">Sudoku Generator</a>. This project now is fundamentaly the same, but uses the supperior features of C++11 over Java and Qt5 over Swing.</p>

##Features
<p>The features of the this project are extending the feature list of the Java implementation by introducing stack generation for OpenSudoku and a larger amount of available export formats (like *.png, *.jpg, *.svg, â€¦).</p>
